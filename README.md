1. **Quality over quantity**: better write a clean small paragraph rather than an entire mediocre course.
2. **Perfection doesn't matter**: Don't worry to write something not perfect: the community will improve it.
3. **Imrove it yourself**: Do not hesitate to modify and improve existing courses.
4. **Science science science**: Everything must be scientifically valid (based on *recent* evidence).
5. **Documentation**: Don't forget to cite the papers (and add a link to its online page).
