# How to Contribute

You found some errors? Something was unclear? You can contribute to the courses by modifying or adding things. See this tutorial ([french](https://github.com/neuropsychology/Courses/blob/master/Programing/Github/Contribute-FR.md) or [english](https://github.com/neuropsychology/Courses/blob/master/Programing/Github/Contribute-EN.md)) to see to add your changes on github.

### General Guidelines:
1. **Quality over quantity**: better write a great small paragraph than an entire mediocre course
2. **Perfection don't matter**: Don't worry to write something not perfect: the community will improve it
3. **Imrove it yourself**: Do not hesitate to modify and improve existing courses
4. **Science science science**: Everything must be scientifically valid (based on *recent* evidence)
5. **Documentation**: Don't forget to cite the papers (and add a link to the paper)


See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr6IzOGoMsQ) for a clear explanation.
